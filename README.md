# HSE-bot
I wrote a bot as homework for university. I used the Groq API model to generate tasks in a telegram bot. This bot creates a truth or dare game based on a given topic. It also supports the following commands:

/start - Start the game and select a theme.

/i_want_to_have_my_game - Start the game and write your theme

/join_game - Join the game after choosing a topic.

/start_game - Start a game with participants.

/view_players - View the list of participants in the current game.

/end_game - End the current game.

/help - Show this message.
